- These are the official 1337x domains. If you came from one with a different domain, then it's fake, and we won't provide support for anything downloaded from there.
- If your ISP has blocked 1337x, then use [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/), a VPN, or a trusted public proxy. Read more: https://1337x-proxy.github.io/
